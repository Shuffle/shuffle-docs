# Open Source vs Enterprise

## Shuffle 🧡 Open Source

Shuffle has been open source from it's inception, and we have no plans to change that. All of our core code is public, and this is so anyone can use Shuffle.

Our business model is based on:
- Being a part of your scaling journey
- Providing support to make the most of our powerful platform

All the features and functionality are available on Open Source, and no features are exclusive. Here's how our development cycle looks:
- Everything new comes to cloud first, and then onprem within a quarter.
- New features come to customers first through `nightly` branch, and then everyone else in due time through `main` branch.

Hence:
- You simply get all features and use Shuffle as truly Open Source.
- When you scale, is when you pay.
- Even when you scale and pay, Shuffle will still be cheaper than any other solution on the market.
- You get a win on both sides:
  - At small or no scale, you pay nothing and get the best platform on the market.
  - When you do pay, you get the best deal / rate on the market.
- This simplifies your decision making. You win and make the best decision either the way.

## Difference between Open Source and Enteprise

The major differences are below:

Our business model works on two fronts:
- Scale: As you grow beyond a point (refer to image above), you get an Enterprise license so that your Shuffle instance scales smoothly without any hiccups.
  - This is done so we set the right expectations for scaling, as our inbox is full of people with scaling issues.
  - Scaling is hard, especially if you are onprem.
  - Hence, we have put a lot of money and resources on R&D for a scalable [Orborus](https://shuffler.io/docs/architecture), which is what you get with an Enterprise License.
- Support: Shuffle is a powerful and versatile platform, and it comes with the challenge of too many options and possibilities. When you want our help or want to make the most of Shuffle, you get a support package from Shuffle that covers:
  - Setup (Architecture + Configuration + Onboarding)
  - Errors
  - Bugs
  - Feature Requests
  - Workflow Development
  - App Development
  - And much more. Think of us as an addition to your team for using Shuffle to it's limits.


## Why enforce Open Source and Scale?

Shuffle is built on trust. People have severly abused it.

The simple and fair solution is to enforce the trust:
- We stay true to Open Source.
- Provide a GREAT platform for EVERYONE with all features and zero evil built-in blockers.
- Small companies get industry-leading platform for free, which was the core idea of Open Source.
- Large companies get a better + cheaper platform in the industry, without a vendor-lock-in, another core idea behind Open Source.
- Win-win for everyone.

This helps us:
- To pay our employees
- Keep Shuffle Open Source
- Spend resources on R&D
- Maintain Shuffle's technical superiority in the market

## Shuffle vs Others

Let's be frank:
- Majority of companies who call themselves Open Source, are not truly Open Source.
  - Many have hidden blockers, evil business practices, or creates their own licenses.
- We are not. We are truly Open Source.
  - We do not block any feature whatsoever, use AGNU-v3 license, and are completely transparent about our business model.

Thus, comparison between Shuffle and others is an apple-to-oranges comparison at best.

## Shuffle's Future

We have no plans to close-source Shuffle.

We went hard on the first iteration of this, so that we can open up more in the future as we find the balance between growth and friction.

We aim to build a fair and sustainable future for Shuffle.
