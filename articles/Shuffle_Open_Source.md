# Shuffle 🧡 Open Source

Shuffle has been open source from its inception, and we have no plans to change that. All of Shuffle's code is public, and this is so anyone can use Shuffle.

Our business model is based on:
- Being a part of your scaling journey
- Providing support to make the most of the powerful Shuffle automation platform

All the [features and functionality](https://shuffler.io/docs/features) are available on Open Source, and no features are exclusive. Here's what our development cycle looks like:
- Everything new comes to [shuffler.io](shuffler.io) first, and then onprem after thorough onprem scale testing.
- New features come through 'nightly' branch releases almost nightly, with 'latest' branch being well tested releases.

What you get:
- You simply get all the features and use Shuffle as truly Open Source.
- When you scale, is when you pay.
- Even when you scale and pay, Shuffle will still be cheaper than any other solution on the market.
  - This is possible due to being available in a wider market, and focus on self-service.
- You get a win on both sides:
  - At small to medium-sized operations, you pay nothing and get the best platform on the market.
  - When you do pay, you get the best deal / rate on the market.
- This simplifies your decision making. You win and make the best decision either the way.

## Difference between Open Source and Enteprise

## Shuffle's Open Source Business Model

Our business model is open and transparentm and works on two fronts:

- **Scale License:** As you grow beyond a point (refer to image above), you get an Enterprise license so that your Shuffle instance scales smoothly without any hiccups.
  - This is done so we set the right expectations for scaling, as our inbox is full of people wanting to scale.
  - Scaling with high availability is hard, especially if you are onprem.
  - Hence, we have put a lot of money and resources on R&D for a scalable distributed [runtime architecture](https://shuffler.io/docs/architecture), which is what you get with an Enterprise License.
- **Support:** Shuffle is a powerful and versatile platform, and it comes with the challenge of too many options and possibilities. When you want our help or want to make the most of Shuffle, you get a support package from Shuffle that covers:
  - Setup (Architecture + Configuration + Onboarding)
  - Error handling
  - Feature Requests
  - Workflow Development
  - App Development
  - And much more. Think of us as an addition to your team for using Shuffle to it's limits.

## Why enforce Open Source and License on Scale?

Shuffle is built on trust. People have **severly** abused it.

The simple and fair solution is to enforce the trust:
- We stay true to Open Source.
- Provide a GREAT platform for EVERYONE with all features and zero evil built-in blockers.
- Small companies get industry-leading platform for free, which was the core idea of Open Source.
- Big companies get a better + cheaper platform in the industry, without a vendor-lock-in; another core idea behind Open Source.
- Win-win for everyone.

**This helps us:**
- Keep Shuffle Open Source
- To pay our GREAT employees
- Reinvest in community building
- Spend resources on R&D
- Maintain Shuffle's technical superiority in the market

## Shuffle vs Others

Let's be frank:

- Majority of companies who call themselves Open Source, are not truly Open Source, but Open Core.
  - Many have hidden blockers, evil business practices, or create their own licenses.
- We don't do that. We are truly Open Source.
  - We do not hide any feature whatsoever, are built on the AGPLv3 license, and are completely transparent about our business model.

By being lean and open source first, it has even made us able to make interesting models for top contributors to get licenses and support cheaper. 

This means comparison of Shuffle-to-Others is an Apple-to-Oranges comparison at best.

## Shuffle's Commitment

- We have no plans to close-source Shuffle. 
- We went hard on the first iteration of scale licensing, so that we can open up more in the future as we find the right balance between growth and friction.
- We aim to build a fair and sustainable future for Shuffle and the Open Source community.

As we are in the early phase, we appreciate any and all feedback on the approach at support@shuffler.io

**With regards**
