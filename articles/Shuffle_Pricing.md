# Overview

Shuffle's pricing is primarily based on two things:
1. License - Based on App-Runs.
2. Support - Based on Post-Onboarding Needs.

We also have [training](https://shuffler.io/training), but it is optional and available if you need it.

## What are App-Runs?

App-runs are the actual actions that run inside your workflow. They are a simple and transparent way to track the platform's usage.

For example, the workflow below has many nodes or 'actions'. Whenever it runs, these actions are counted as app-runs.

IMP: Only the actions that run are counted; the rest are ignored and not counted. In the workflow below, even though it has many actions, if it stops at the (red) filter action, only 4 app-runs are counted.

## Why Shuffle Pricing Works

Shuffle's pricing is market-leading. Why? Read single sentence explanations below...

1. App-Runs Based: Shuffle's licensing cost is only based on app-runs. Everything else is unlimited

2. Cost Effective: Shuffle's app-run pricing is the most inexpensive on the market, period.

3. Incentivizes Efficiency: Given that app-runs are actual actions that runs inside your workflow, it incentivizes everyone to build efficient and fast automations.

4. Scale Discounts: Shuffle offers growing discounts so that your cost does not increase with increase in your scale.
